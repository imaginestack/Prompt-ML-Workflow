# Templates Folder - README

## Overview
This folder contains templates designed to provide a consistent structure and ensure efficiency when working on complex, multi-layered stack projects. The templates here serve as starting points for documenting prompts, workflows, and project configurations, making it easier to maintain a standardized approach throughout the project lifecycle.

## Contents
- **Prompt Documentation Template**: A template for documenting prompts, including objectives, input structure, examples, and expected outcomes. This helps ensure prompt consistency and effectiveness.
- **Workflow Review Template**: A template to review workflows, capturing key steps, optimization opportunities, and points of improvement. Useful for iterative refinement of project processes.
- **IaC Configuration Template**: Templates for Infrastructure-as-Code configurations, such as Kubernetes manifests, Tailscale configurations, and HAProxy load balancing setups. These templates aim to provide a solid starting point for various stack configurations.

## How to Use This Folder
- **Document Your Prompts**: Use the prompt documentation template to ensure every prompt used in the project is clearly defined, easily repeatable, and consistent with project requirements.
- **Streamline Workflow Reviews**: Utilize the workflow review template to capture detailed notes and feedback during the evaluation of different processes or project phases.
- **Consistent Stack Setup**: Adapt the IaC configuration templates to match your specific environment while retaining key elements that follow best practices.

## Contribution
If you are adding templates to this folder, please ensure that:
- **They Are Flexible**: Each template should be general enough to adapt to different use cases but specific enough to provide real value without excessive modifications.
- **They Are Well-Explained**: Include instructions or comments within the template to help users understand how to use it effectively.
- **They Improve Standardization**: Ensure the templates contribute to the goal of standardizing the documentation, configuration, and workflow review process.

## Next Steps
- Expand the templates to cover additional types of configurations, such as monitoring and observability setups, or security best practices.
- Regularly update the templates based on user feedback and evolving project needs to ensure they remain relevant and useful.
- Add more templates to support specific tools or emerging technologies within the project scope.
