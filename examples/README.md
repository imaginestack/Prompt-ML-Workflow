# Examples Folder - README

## Overview
This folder contains examples that demonstrate the application of different strategies and techniques discussed in the documentation. The examples provided aim to offer practical insights and serve as reference implementations to help configure and manage complex, multi-layered stack projects effectively.

## Contents
- **Chain-of-Thought Prompt Examples**: Examples of using Chain-of-Thought prompting to break down complex problems into smaller, logical steps.
- **Prompt Optimization Workflow**: Sample prompts showing different approaches to optimization, highlighting successful strategies and potential pitfalls.
- **Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) Scripts**: Example scripts for Kubernetes, Tailscale, Cilium, and HAProxy to illustrate how to configure specific components and workflows.
- **Collaborative Setup Scenarios**: Real-world examples demonstrating collaboration setups, including how Canvas is used for real-time edits and brainstorming.

## How to Use This Folder
- **Learn by Example**: Review provided examples to understand how the documented strategies and concepts are practically applied in real-world scenarios.
- **Reference for Implementation**: Use the example scripts as a starting point or reference when setting up your own stack. Adapt these examples to fit your specific requirements.
- **Compare Strategies**: Explore different prompt styles and workflows to identify which approaches work best for your project requirements.

## Contribution
If you are adding examples to this folder, please ensure that:
- **They Are Functional**: Each example should be functional and thoroughly tested. Include any necessary dependencies and setup instructions.
- **They Are Well-Documented**: Include comments and explanations within scripts or prompts to help others understand the purpose and logic behind them.
- **They Cover Key Use Cases**: Provide examples that cover diverse scenarios, including edge cases, to ensure comprehensive coverage of different stack configurations.

## Next Steps
- Add examples for new tools or strategies introduced in the project documentation.
- Expand the examples to cover additional use cases, such as security hardening or failover configurations.
- Regularly update the examples based on feedback and evolving best practices.
