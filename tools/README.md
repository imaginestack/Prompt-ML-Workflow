# Tools Folder - README

## Overview
This folder contains tools, utility scripts, and setup guides that are essential for implementing and managing the complex, multi-layered stack configurations discussed in the documentation. The tools here are intended to streamline project setup, facilitate configuration, and enhance the overall efficiency of stack management.

## Contents
- **Helicone Setup Guide**: A guide on setting up Helicone to facilitate prompt management, versioning, and analytics.
- **LangChain Integration Scripts**: Scripts and instructions for integrating LangChain into the workflow to enable enhanced prompt management.
- **Infrastructure Automation Tools**: Utility scripts for automating configuration tasks using Python, Bash, or other languages for Kubernetes, Tailscale, Cilium, and HAProxy.
- **Troubleshooting Utilities**: Tools and scripts that help diagnose and troubleshoot issues with network configuration, load balancing, or other stack components.

## How to Use This Folder
- **Setup Guides**: Follow the guides for step-by-step instructions on setting up and configuring various tools that are part of the stack. These guides will help ensure all components are integrated correctly.
- **Automation Scripts**: Use the provided scripts to automate repetitive tasks, such as infrastructure deployment, network setup, or maintenance. These scripts are designed to save time and reduce human error.
- **Troubleshooting Support**: Reference troubleshooting utilities to help identify, debug, and solve issues encountered during the configuration and management of stack components.

## Contribution
If you are adding tools or scripts to this folder, please ensure that:
- **They Are Well-Tested**: All tools and scripts should be functional and tested in an environment similar to the one described in the project documentation.
- **They Include Documentation**: Provide a README or comments within the script to explain usage, configuration, and any dependencies needed.
- **They Improve Efficiency**: The goal of these tools is to enhance workflow efficiency, whether through automation, diagnostics, or improved integration.

## Next Steps
- Add tools and utilities for any newly introduced stack components, such as additional network plugins or load balancers.
- Expand the current scripts to include more automation options for advanced configurations or edge cases.
- Regularly update tools based on evolving best practices and user feedback to ensure they remain relevant and effective.
